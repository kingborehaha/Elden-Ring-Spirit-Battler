## Elden Ring Spirit Battler is a tool to set up custom encounters in Elden Ring via spirit ash summons.
- Summon vs summon. Watch them fight as a bystander
- Player vs summon. Set up an encounter to defeat
- Free for All. Somebody will win, might even be you
- Custom Spirit Ash. You ever want to summon 10 Radahns?
- Whatever you want!

## Features
- Customize entire fights with any enemy you want, up to 10 enemies at once
- Teams to determine who enemies hate and who they will ally with
- Pick phantom shaders for each team. Invaders? Spirit Summons? Completely invisible? All options! (Customizable phantoms TBA)
- Customize stats as desired. Want Radahn scaled the same as Melania for a fair fight? Want a crab that does 100x damage? Go hog wild
- Hidden player mode. Watch fights without distract enemies (or appearing on-camera)
- Set exactly where summons will appear. You can define arbitrary offsets, or just use one of the helpful presets if you don't want the hassle
- Mod compatability! Just run this tool after everything else has been installed.

## WARNINGS
- The current version of Mod Engine 2 does not manage save files, so if you have existing saves: go to "AppData\Roaming\EldenRing" and backup the save files within. Restore these backups before playing online, or you could potentially be banned.
- Do not run this tool on Regulation.bin in Elden Ring's "Game" folder. If you do and play online, you could potentially be banned.

## How to Use
- Download Mod Engine 2 https://github.com/soulsmods/ModEngine2/releases
- If you have no other mods installed, locate your Elden Ring installation and find regulation.bin, then copy and paste regulation.bin into your Mod Engine 2 "Mod" folder
- If you do have other mods installed, just find the regulation.bin already in your Mod folder
- Use this tool to browse and load the copied regulation.bin
- Hover the mouse over options for tips!
- Create teams and enemies as desired, then choose which Spirit Ash to overwrite
- Save Changes. The selected ash should now be changed in-game
