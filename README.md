## Elden Ring Spirit Battler is a tool to set up custom encounters in Elden Ring via spirit ash summons.
- Summon vs summon. Watch them fight as a bystander.
- Player vs summon. Set up an encounter to defeat.
- Free for All. Somebody will win. Might even be you!
- Custom Spirit Ash. Malenia too hard? Just summon 10 Radahns.

## Features
- Customize entire fights with any enemy you want, up to 10 enemies at once
- Teams to determine who enemies hate and who they will ally with
- Pick phantom shaders for each team. Invaders? Spirit Summons? Completely invisible? All options! (Customizable phantoms TBA)
- Customize stats as desired. Want Radahn scaled the same as Melania for a fair fight? Want a crab that does 100x damage? Go hog wild
- Hidden player mode. Watch fights without distract enemies (or appearing on-camera)
- Set exactly where summons will appear. You can define arbitrary offsets, or just use one of the helpful presets if you don't want the hassle
- Mod compatability! Just run this tool after everything else has been installed.

## WARNINGS
- The current version of Mod Engine 2 does not manage save files, so if you have existing saves: go to "AppData\Roaming\EldenRing" and backup the save files within. Restore these backups before playing online, or you could potentially be banned.
- Do not run this tool on Regulation.bin in Elden Ring's "Game" folder. If you do and play online, you could potentially be banned.

## How to Use
- Download Mod Engine 2: https://github.com/soulsmods/ModEngine2/releases
- Download and install .NET Desktop Runtime 6.0: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0
